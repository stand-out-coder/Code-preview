# Code-preview
**Code-preview** is a program for sketching code in a "new programming language". For example, you have created your own programming language and want to see the beauty of its syntax, this program is for you.

***Code-preview*** is a program with a simple interface where you can write code and edit its style (color and attributes).
Everything is simple! First you select the text to which you want to apply the style, then you need to click on the Choose Font/Choose Color button and select the desired style and apply it by clicking on the OK button.

> (Unfortunately for now, you'll need to take a screenshot of the code yourself....)

**Color Choice:**
